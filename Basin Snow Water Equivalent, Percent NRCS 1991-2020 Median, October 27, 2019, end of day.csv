Values are summed and divided by the sum of normals for the same set of stations, and multiplied by 100.  In the case where all stations have a normal=0, no basin index percentage will be calculated.","Hoodoo Basin (SNTL); Humboldt Gulch; Lookout; Lost Lake (SNTL); Mica Creek; Mosquito Ridge; Quartz Peak; Ragged Mountain (SNTL); Sherwin; Sunset","10","Humboldt Gulch; Lookout; Lost Lake (SNTL); Mica Creek; Mosquito Ridge; Quartz Peak; Ragged Mountain (SNTL); Sherwin; Sunset","9","625","Hoodoo Basin (SNTL)","1.8","N/A","Humboldt Gulch","0.1","0","Lookout","0.1","0","Lost Lake (SNTL)","2.6","0.6","Mica Creek","0","0","Mosquito Ridge","1.3","0.2","Quartz Peak","0","0","Ragged Mountain (SNTL)","0.2","0","Sherwin","0","0","Sunset","0.7","0"
